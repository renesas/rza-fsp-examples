1. Project Overview:
  The example project demonstrates the use of WDT module with the collaboration of module IRQ, GTM, WDT and button/led. 
  The operation of this EP is as below:
	- Start GTM timer having a callback every 1 second, to refresh WDT and blink the led (User LED1 on board).
	- If the User SW1 on board is pressed, IRQ is triggered, the LED (User LED1 on board) is OFF and program is 
    exit.

2. Hardware Requirement:
     1 Board RZ/A3M Evaluation Kit
     1 USB type C cable

3. Hardware settings:
