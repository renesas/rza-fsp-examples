1. Project Overview:
    - The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of USB_HMSC running on Renesas RZ MPUs using RZ/A board, USB.
    - Format the USB driver with FAT32 file system before performing any operation
    - After successful USB connection with PC, the Terminal Emulator shows menu options with 4 options
    - The user select option 1 to write 10K data from app_buffer
    - The user enters data into the Terminal Emulator, and the data is saved to the rza_usb.txt file
    - The user select option 2 to Format USB Driver
    - The user select option 3 to Safely Eject the USB Driver before removing USB
    - The user select option 4 to Initialize FreeRTOS+FAT (Valid only after Safely_Eject option is executed)
