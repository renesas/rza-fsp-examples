1. Project Overview:
	The example projects demonstrates Message Queue and Semaphore between tasks and interrupt. Message Queue is 
	demonstrated between Tasks and between Task and interrupt. GTM timer periodically generates interrupt at 1000msec. 
	For first few seconds, messages are shared between Sender and Receiver Tasks and GTM ISR0. Receiver task pends on 
	Message Queue, receives and displays message received on TeraTerm periodically at 500msec. For next few seconds, 
	Semaphore Task waits for sempahore until it is released by GTM ISR1. GTM ISR1 releases semaphore periodically 
	at 1000msec. All the tasks run with equal priority level.

2. Hardware Requirement:
     1 Board RZ/A3UL Evaluation Board Kit

3. Hardware settings:
    Boot Mode:
