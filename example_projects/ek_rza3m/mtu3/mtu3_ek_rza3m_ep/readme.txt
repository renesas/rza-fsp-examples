1. Project Overview:
    The example project demonstrates typical use of MTU3 HAL module APIs.
    User has the provision to input value as per displayed menu through a terminal application to select different MTU3 
    supported modes(Periodic, PWM, One-Shot). 
    In periodic mode, user can enter the time period within the permitted ranges to change the frequency of the user LED. 
    In PWM mode, user can enter the duty cycle within the specified range to adjust the intensity of the user LED. 
    In One-Shot mode, output will be displayed on a terminal application. 
    Any failure will also be displayed on a terminal application.

2. Hardware Requirement:
    1 Board RZ/A3M Evaluation Kit
    1 USB type C cable

3. Hardware settings:
    Boot Mode:
    Boot mode 4 (3.3-V Single or Quad serial NOR flash memory)
