1. Project Overview:
     The example project demonstrates the typical use of the INTC TINT module APIs.
     The project initializes the TINT interrupt in Interrupt Controller.
     User is requested to press the push-button to trigger the external tint 
     and this then will start toggling of LEDs.

2. Hardware Requirement:
     1 Board RZ/A3UL Evaluation Board Kit
     1 PMOD LED 
     1 PMOD BUTTON

3. Hardware settings:
    Boot Mode:
    Boot mode 3 (1.8-V Single, Quad, or Octal serial flash memory)

    Board:
    RZ/A3UL Evaluation Board Kit QSPI Edition  (Exec with DDR SDRAM)
    RZ/A3UL Evaluation Board Kit QSPI Edition  (eXecute-In-Place)
    RZ/A3UL Evaluation Board Kit OCTAL Edition (eXecute-In-Place)

4. Hardware Connection:
    (1) Set for DIP switches and jumpers as follow.

        <<Setting for Module board>>
         - SW1-1 : OFF 
           SW1-2 : Don't care
         - SW1-3 : OFF

        <<Setting for Carrier board>>
         - SW1    : Don't care
           SW2    : Don't care
